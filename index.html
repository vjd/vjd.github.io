        Open Source in Pharmacometrics - ACoP7
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Tue, Nov 1, 2016</span>

    <p>The 7<sup>th</sup> American Confernce in Pharmacometrics was held in Seattle, Washington from October 23 - 27, 2016. On the last day of the conference, there was a session named - <strong><em>&ldquo;An Overview of Consortia and Open-Source Approaches to Quantitative Drug Development Tools&rdquo;</em></strong>. This was the first time in my short experience in this field that there has been a discussion on the concept of &ldquo;sharing&rdquo; in pharmacometrics. It was bold, new and exciting to see initiatives being taken in our community towards being more collaborative.</p>

<p>You can find the list of speakers and topic session in the conference program page <a href="http://www.acop7.org/conference-program">here</a>. In the spirit of the topic, all the speakers decided to share their presentations and collaboratively work in the <a href="https://osf.io/csjf7/">Open Science Framework</a> (you need to sign up to the website to use it). All presentations made there will be posted here eventually.</p>

<p>I would like to summarize to the best of my ability, the overall message of that session.</p>

<ol>
<li>There was a clear understanding that there needs to be a shift in the culture of doing science in pharmacometrics to be more open and collaborative.</li>
<li>There was renewed enthusiasm to work on grander challenges in a consortia setting. Many different consortia were introduced and some of them are listed here:

<ul>
<li>C-Path Initiative - develops models in consortia for Alzheimers, TB and Polycystic Kidney Disease</li>
<li>Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) consortia</li>
<li>The Right Dose Consortia</li>
<li>NeuroD Community of Practice under the C-Path initiatives</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There was discussion on the opportunities that we as a community have to influence precision dosing in the clinic and not just to influence drug development projects.</li>
<li>A common interest towards crowdsourced incentive based solutions to

<ul>
<li>Convert published literature models into R based models</li>
<li>Submit these R based models to the DDMore Model Repository</li>
<li>Develop a crowdsourced meta analysis database that allows micro-contributions from researchers all around the world</li>
<li>Develop an incentive platform to solve grand challenges in the quantitative clinical drug development and clinical therapeutics</li>
<li>Develop training material that are freely accessible to the community</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A new R-based non-linear mixed effect modeling engine called <strong><em><a href="https://github.com/nlmixrdevelopment/nlmixr">nlmixr</a></em></strong></li>
<li>Drive towards pre-print publications using the [bioarxiv]() platform</li>
<li>The most important aspect - there was huge shout out to the champions and their open source tools that are already available in pharmacometrics. The banner image is a timeline and list of the many open source tools available in pharmacometrics as of today.</li>
</ol>

<p>There was a lot of enthusiasm at the end of the session about the prospects of an open and collaborative community in pharmacometrics. One of the ideas that was a result of this session is the <strong><em>Osmosis Project</em></strong> that stands for Open Source Modeling and Simulation Solutions, a term coined by Marc Gastonguay of <a href="http://metrumrg.com/index.html">Metrum Institute</a>. The project will work closely with the excellent efforts of the <strong><em><a href="http://www.ddmore.eu/">DDMore</a></em></strong> consortium and its various aspects. More details will follow up in subsequent posts. Keep an eye out!</p>

        Why Now?

    <p>I am flying back to Baltimore after attending the Singularity conference on <a href="http://exponentialmedicine.com/">Exponential Medicine</a> at the beautiful Hotel Del Cornado in San Diego. I am pretty impressed with myself that I am sitting calm and writing instead of bouncing around in the plane like flubber - optimistic about the future, excited about the opportunities, thankful to have met some extraordinary people and developed some life-long relationships with peers in different walks of life. The reason I am able to sit calm is because all this excitement has thrown me into self-reflection mode. What have I done so far, what am I doing now and what lies for me in the future. Note that the use of &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;me&rdquo; is only in the context of making my useful out there in this world of opportunities and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been excited and optimistic for a long time now, but never formulated my thoughts, never gave them structure and it was all talking. I am writing now in a hope to achieve a few things -</p>

<ol>
<li>Document my thoughts so that the future me can look back at the present and past me</li>
<li>Give myself a direction from my current vantage point by looking at how can I make a difference, even if it is a small one - tangible ones</li>
<li>Most importantly, achieve/implement actionable items by following up on what I write, as it is much easier to slip away when you talk.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have any set of specific topics. They will probably be based on the what I am doing at that specific time. I have been heavily influenced by great role models that I will bring up often.</p>

<p>Give me a shout out if you don&rsquo;t hear from me here.</p>
