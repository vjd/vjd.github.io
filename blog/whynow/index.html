			 	<h1>Why Now?</h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Wed, Oct 12, 2016</span>
			      <p>I am flying back to Baltimore after attending the Singularity conference on <a href="http://exponentialmedicine.com/">Exponential Medicine</a> at the beautiful Hotel Del Cornado in San Diego. I am pretty impressed with myself that I am sitting calm and writing instead of bouncing around in the plane like flubber - optimistic about the future, excited about the opportunities, thankful to have met some extraordinary people and developed some life-long relationships with peers in different walks of life. The reason I am able to sit calm is because all this excitement has thrown me into self-reflection mode. What have I done so far, what am I doing now and what lies for me in the future. Note that the use of &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;me&rdquo; is only in the context of making my useful out there in this world of opportunities and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been excited and optimistic for a long time now, but never formulated my thoughts, never gave them structure and it was all talking. I am writing now in a hope to achieve a few things -</p>

<ol>
<li>Document my thoughts so that the future me can look back at the present and past me</li>
<li>Give myself a direction from my current vantage point by looking at how can I make a difference, even if it is a small one - tangible ones</li>
<li>Most importantly, achieve/implement actionable items by following up on what I write, as it is much easier to slip away when you talk.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have any set of specific topics. They will probably be based on the what I am doing at that specific time. I have been heavily influenced by great role models that I will bring up often.</p>

<p>Give me a shout out if you don&rsquo;t hear from me here.</p>
